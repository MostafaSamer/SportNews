      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">In his words: How Daniel Jacobs became boxing's 'Miracle Man'</h1>
      <cite>Daniel Jacobs (33-2, 29 KOs) hopes for another shot at middleweight No. 1 Gennady Golovkin. First, though, he'll have to get past undefeated Polish fighter Maciej Sulęcki on Saturday at Barclays.</cite>
      <hr>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\daniel-jacobs.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>A SMALL, BLACK door, just off a run-of-the-mill corner block in Brooklyn, opens to a dark, narrow flight of stairs that you'd hesitate to descend if not for the pictures of boxers, belts and trophies on the walls. At the bottom, once your eyes adjust, a boxing ring and a fighter with a deep well of gratitude take shape in the low light.</p>
      <p>Daniel "The Miracle Man" Jacobs, a complete middleweight with lightning-quick hands, stout defense and a powerful left hook, was surging up the ranks seven years ago when his legs were paralyzed by a life-threatening tumor that wrapped around his spine. Incredibly, he returned to the ring after 18 months, winning a title and defending it four times before narrowly losing to world No. 1 Gennady Golovkin last March. With his unanimous 12-round decision in November over previously undefeated Luis Arias, Jacobs (33-2, 29 KOs) hopes for another shot at Golovkin. First, though, he'll have to get past undefeated Polish fighter Maciej Sulęcki (26-0, 10 KOs) on Saturday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Jacobs, 31, broke from a speed-and-conditioning workout to talk about staring down cancer, defying doctors' orders and why his left pinky toe is a constant reminder of his great fortune.</p>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\21yo-daniel.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <cite>Jacobs, shown here training in Brooklyn recently, was 22-1 and on his way up the ranks in 2011 when he noticed a tingling in his leg. He was eventually paralyzed by a tumor that wrapped around his spine.</cite>
      <h3>OUT OF THE BLUE</h3>
      <p>In March 2011, Jacobs buried Robert Kliewer with punches from the opening bell, sending him to the canvas for the second and final time at 1:44 of the first round. Weeks later, Jacobs (22-1) had joined a tour of Iraq to visit troops when he noticed pain and tingling in his leg.</p>
      <p><h5>"The doctors misdiagnosed me at first -- they told me I had a pinched nerve. But my situation was getting worse. The tumor was cutting off the circulation in my nerves. And in two weeks' time, I was left paralyzed. I went from a cane to crutches to a walker to a wheelchair. The second time I went to the hospital, they had to do more tests. That's when they were able to pinpoint exactly what was wrong. They were gonna cut through my chest -- if you know anything about boxing, anything like that and your career is over. Fortunately for me, I was able to get surgery through my back."</h5></p>
      <h3>"ONLY PLACE I WANTED TO BE"</h3>
      <cite>Jacobs says the aggressive tumor on his spine might have been a death sentence, but it was detected with only days to spare. His rehabilitation took more than a year of not-so-patient healing and extremely grueling physical therapy -- pain worse than anything he'd felt in the ring.</cite>
      <p><h5>"We were in the ICU, and I remember just being in a really, really dark place. It was a hard process. But once I got out of the hospital, once I learned how to walk again, I went back [to the gym] immediately. It was against doctor's orders, obviously -- the doctors told me I would never be able to box again. I just remember getting out of the hospital, and the only place I wanted to be was the boxing gym."</h5></p>
      <p><h5>"I had such severe nerve damage that I didn't get the nerves all the way back. My pinky toe on my left foot is still numb, and I feel it when I'm in bed at night or when I'm by myself. That pins-and-needles feeling reminds me that life is precious, and don't take for granted what you have. But being in that hospital bed for so long, I was missing those things that I couldn't do, that my trainers used to have to force me to do. I was like, man, if I could only run that extra mile, if I could skip rope that extra two or three rounds or spar an extra five rounds. There's no bigger motivator."</h5></p>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\daniels-son.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <cite>Jacobs, shown with his son Nathaniel, says he emerged from his health crisis with a "whole new mentality."</cite>
      <h3>FROM 'GOLDEN CHILD' TO 'MIRACLE MAN'</h3>
      <cite>He returned to the ring in Oct. 20, 2012, with a first-round demolition of fellow Brooklynite Josh Luteran. A right hand followed by a left-right combo sent Luteran back, his head bouncing off the canvas. It was the first of 10 successive knockouts for Jacobs, including his TKO of Jerrod Fletcher for the vacant WBA title on Aug. 9, 2014. Jacobs credits his post-cancer success to a change of perspective.</cite>
      <p><h5>"Prior to this whole cancer situation, I remember reading -- I'm not really religious, but I'm a spiritual guy -- a word called 'meek.' And I remember at that time I was called 'The Golden Child,' and that was a guy who had seen all the glitz and glamour as a kid and wanted to live that life. I was living life in the wrong way, and I was just like, 'Man, I don't want to lose my sense of direction. [God] allow me to understand what the word meek means.' And about two months later, that's when I was diagnosed with cancer. So after getting back to a place where I could finally box again, I remember sitting down, and it was like, 'Wow. This was a really great experience for me, to understand what the word meek means and apply it in my life.' And from that point on, I just adopted a whole new mentality."</h5></p>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\latest-daniel.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <cite>Last March, Jacobs narrowly lost a unanimous decision to Golovkin. He believes the title should have been his.</cite>
      <h3>HIS HAPPY PLACE</h3>
      <cite>On March 18, 2017, Jacobs gave GGG the toughest fight of his career, taking him to 12 rounds at Madison Square Garden. Jacobs was knocked down in the fourth after briefly switching to a southpaw stance, but he rallied late, landing a solid right in the 10th that seemed to stun Golovkin. Two judges scored it 115-112, and one had it 114-113, all for Golovkin.</cite>
      <p><h5>"You really don't know what you're made of until you get in there with the best. Some argue that I won, some argue that I lost. Draw your own conclusion, but at the end of the day, it was a win-win situation. For me, it let me know that I belong, that I can go in there and bang with the best of them. And it's a great feeling. Because I truly believe that I won the fight, and I truly believe that I am the best middleweight in the world. And having that chip on your shoulder, having that in the back of your head is a great little boost to have inside that ring."</h5></p>
      <p><h5>"All of this is destined. All of this wasn't a coincidence. I think of all the things that I dreamed of, and they're slowly but surely starting to come true. Who would've thought I'd have these opportunities, especially years ago when I was in that hospital bed, when pretty much everyone wrote me off? I'm at the most blissful place in my life, the happiest place in my career."</h5></p>

      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Amir Khan takes inspiration from heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua as he finally returns to the ring</h1>
      <cite>Khan faces Canadian Phil Lo Greco in Liverpool on Saturday 23 months after he was beaten by Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas</cite>
      <hr>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\khan.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>Amir Khan fights in Britain for the first time in five years on Saturday and admits the emergence of homegrown boxers like Anthony Joshua has fuelled his comeback.</p>
      <p>Khan faces Canadian Phil Lo Greco in Liverpool on Saturday 23 months after he was beaten by Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas, and five years since he last fought on these shores against Julio Diaz in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Joshua had not even started his professional career then but the current world heavyweight champion's ascent, in bouts that have all taken place in Britain, has ensured the sport's popularity has risen.</p>
      <p>And Khan, who has buried the hatchet with Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn to sign a three-fight deal with Matchroom, admits watching high-profile fights in Britain from ringside partially motivated him to return.</p>
      <h5>"You look at these great fighters like Joshua cleaning up, doing really well, knocking guys out, selling out stadiums and I'm like, 'Wow, this is where I want to be again'," the 31-year-old said.</h5>
      <h5>"I've done it in the past and I want to do it again. I know I've got a style where the crowd will come and watch me and want to see me."</h5>

      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Flawless and full of his old magic, Carl Frampton put on that rarest of things - an actual boxing masterclass</h1>
      <cite>The Northern Irishman boxed glorious rings round Nonito Donaire in a beautiful controlled display</cite>
      <hr>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\carl-frampton-4.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>The old magic was back on Saturday night in Belfast when Carl Frampton boxed glorious rings round Nonito Donaire in a flawless display that often resembled choreography.</p>
      <p>Little Carl fell out of love with boxing last year when his first defeat rattled him and several hostile calamities away from the ring looked like putting an early end to his career.<h5>“It’s been a hard time,”</h5><p> admitted Frampton, who has a court case with his former promoter, Barry McGuigan, looming.</p> <p><h5>“I needed my best, I had to be sharp - it was a simple display, I had to be disciplined in every round.”</h5></p>
      <p>Boxers in similar circumstances often fall terribly short when they are fighting for their lives with a head full of awful distractions. Frampton put on a masterclass in front of his devoted flock to end any doubts about his future, any suggestions his best nights are over and any wild notion that he is an easy touch for anybody.</p>

      <hr style="visibility:visible; width:900px; height:1px; background-color:black;">

      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury both aware they must wait for the biggest fights despite protesting otherwise</h1>
      <cite>The two heavyweight kings have spent an awful lot of time talking about fights they know are unlikely to happen anytime soon</cite>
      <hr>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\joshua-fury.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>Two undefeated heavyweight world champions, two central London speaking arrangements that could not have been more different.</p>
      <p>First Tyson Fury. At the Four Seasons Hotel the boxing press and amateur videographers assembled, eager for the soundbite and slice of drama the controversial but brilliant gypsy guarantees them.</p>
      <p><h5>“I’m now back to claim what is rightfully mine,”</h5></p><p>he growled into a crackling microphone, having squeezed himself into a bold burgundy suit which made him look like Al Murray, The Pub Landlord on a particularly menacing evening.</p><p><h5>“This is going to be one of the longest comebacks in history of a heavyweight champion.”</h5></p>
      <p>A few hours later and it was Anthony Joshua’s turn to hold court, across town at The O2 in Greenwich. Unlike Fury however, he was not grilled by half-interested journalists noisily tapping on their laptops, but by a well-dressed crowd tweeting their decidedly less searching questions with the hashtag ‘AskAJ’. They had paid between £60-£80 for the privilege and for the occasion Joshua wore a noticeably more expensive suit than his rival.</p>
      <p>And yet for all of their many differences, from the dress code to the clientele, the two events shared something of a common theme. Both Fury and Joshua spent an awful lot of their time on stage talking about men they know they are unlikely to be fighting next, despite the clamour of fight fans and their protestations otherwise. We already know that Fury will be forced to wait before being handed the chance to win back his belts from Joshua, who in turn is looking equally unlikely to fight Deontay Wilder next time out.</p>
      <p>Fury may have a plethora of opponents lining up to take him on in June — for Joshua there are only a few. The logical next step would of course be an unprecedented unification showdown with WBC champion Wilder, the brash American with a fairly formidable record of 40-0, 39 knockouts. And yet, if Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn are to be believed, Wilder is a megalomaniac penny-pincher running scared.</p>
      <p> <h5>“It’s a shame for the sport of boxing because with Wilder this fight has just become all about the money,”</h5> Joshua earnestly told Adam Smith when asked about his next move. <h5>“We are talking about a lot of dough to fight — a serious amount — and he is still asking for more. I think he’s going to retire soon anyway, he’s had 40 fights, he’s 32 years old with a bad hand and a bad bicep. He wants an escape route.”</h5></p>
      <p>Hearn was eventually wheeled out to hammer home the point. <h5>“Every day people tell me to make the Wilder fight or accuse me of being a conman but we cannot go any faster than we are currently going. We made an offer to him this week that was five times his biggest ever purse, with an offer to make even more in the second, but he hasn’t accepted it.”</h5></p>
      <p>With each passing day it becomes more unlikely that Joshua will fight Wilder next — although how much of that is the much maligned American’s fault is up for debate. Joshua has a growing line of mandatory challengers to consider, while there are still some doubts within his camp over how he would fare against Wilder’s unusual and harmful style, doubts shared by his friend and former opponent, Wladimir Klitschko. <h5>“I’m not saying he wouldn’t win it but Wilder has something,”</h5> he conceded to The Sunday Times over the weekend.</p>
      <p>And so the sensible if not especially subtle plan is now to firmly establish in the minds of the public that it is Wilder and not Joshua who is to blame for the lack of announcement, while quietly exploring other options. Prior to the event Joshua even admitted as much. <h5>“[Jarrell] Miller or [Alexander] Povetkin,”</h5> he replied when asked backstage who he was most likely to fight next.</p>
      <p><h5>“If I was to list which (negotiations) would be easiest I'd put them at the start. When these guys haven't got much to lose they're more serious, they know they've got everything to gain.”</h5></p>

      <hr style="visibility:visible; width:900px; height:1px; background-color:black;">

      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Canelo Alvarez officially withdraws from Gennady Golovkin rematch after failed drugs test</h1>
      <cite>Golden Boy Promotions announced on Tuesday that the May 5 rematch is officially off</cite>
      <hr>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\canelo-rematch-off.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>Canelo Alvarez’s planned May 5 rematch with Gennady Golovkin has officially been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The Mexican boxer’s withdrawal from the middleweight title fight was announced at a news conference on Tuesday. His decision comes after he twice tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol in the lead-up to the rematch.</p>
      <p>Canelo was handed a temporary suspension by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, who last week filed a formal complaint against the boxer seeking disciplinary action, to be decided at an April 18 hearing in Las Vegas. Their complaint immediately threw the fight into serious doubt.</p>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\canelo-ggg-rematch.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p><h5>“It’s unlikely this matter will be resolved by [April 18] properly and obviously we need enough time to promote a fight of this magnitude,”</h5> Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A statement from Canelo’s promoters blamed the pair of failed tests on “meat contamination that has impacted dozens of athletes in Mexico over the last years”, but the NASC were quick to make clear that – under Nevada rules – the athlete is responsible for what enters his system, whether intentional or unintentional.</p>
      <p>As such, Gomez added that he did not believe Alvarez would have been cleared by the NASC to fight Golovkin on May 5.</p>
      <p>Because clenbuterol is classified as a prohibited anabolic agent, the Mexican boxer now faces a minimum one-year suspension. The commission could hand him an even longer ban, but as a first-time offender he could also have his suspension halved to just six-months if he fully cooperates with their investigation.</p>
      <p>A six-month suspension backdated to the date of the first positive test means that the 27-year-old could be eligible to box again on August 17, meaning his eagerly anticipated rematch with Golovkin could be rescheduled for the Mexican Independence Day weekend in mid-September.</p>
      <p>However, Golovkin’s team have indicated that the Kazakh is determined to fight on May 5 and have already started contacting potential opponents.</p>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\canelo-a.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p><h5>“GGG wants to fight on May 5 in Las Vegas, so in order to do that we have to go through the commission procedure and the official process,”</h5> his promoter, Tom Loeffler, said earlier this week.</p>
      <p><h5>“Anyone who booked a plane ticket or who was planning to come to Las Vegas for Cinco de Mayo weekend to see GGG fight, don't cancel your ticket, because we're planning a GGG fight on May 5, whether it's against Canelo or somebody else.”</h5></p>
      <p>Sergiy Derevyanchenko, Demetrius Andrade and the Irish boxer Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan are all in the frame to replace Canelo. But Billy Joe Saunders – who holds the WBO middleweight strap – injured his hand in a training session ahead of his fight with Martin Murray, and so would be unable to make the date.</p>

      <hr style="visibility:visible; width:900px; height:1px; background-color:black;">

      <h1 style="font-size:40px;">Tommy Coyle upsets Sean Dodd, scores impressive KO win</h1>
      <img src="../../image/Boxing/imgs\tommy.jpg" style="width:800px; margin-left:40px;"></img>
      <p>Tommy Coyle looked refreshed after a 14-month break as he overwhelmed Sean Dodd in the sixth round to become Commonwealth lightweight champion on Saturday on the Amir Khan-Phil Lo Greco undercard at Liverpool's Echo Arena.</p>
      <p>After defeats to Tyrone Nurse and Luke Campbell, Coyle needed a boost and got it after delivering a sharp performance despite the layoff.</p>
      <p>Coyle floored Dodd in the fourth and sixth rounds before referee Bob Williams stopped the fight, and afterward, he revealed he almost quit in January.</p>
      <p><h5>"I nearly walked away from boxing after my last fight, I spent some time in hospital after my last fight even though I won,"</h5> Coyle said.</p>
      <p><h5>"But I thought, 'Let's have one more roll of the dice,' and I'm here as a new champion."</h5></p>
      <p>Coyle would not confirm if he will continue boxing and face British champion Lewis Ritson.</p>
      <p>Dodd (15-3-1, 3 KOs), 33, was making a second defense of the Commonwealth title after impressively beating Thomas Stalker in September. But Coyle (24-4, 12 KOs) took control in the third round, when he shook Dodd with a right to the temple.</p>
      <p>Dodd was lucky to survive the fourth round after his knees were buckled by an overhand right and was then floored by a follow-up left.</p>
      <p>It was late in the round, and Dodd was grateful for the bell, but Coyle continued to look good in the fifth.</p>
      <p>Coyle, who is from Hull, like 2012 Olympic gold medalist Campbell, got better as the fight went on and in the sixth decked Dodd again with a right.</p>
      <p>Dodd got up but Coyle launched a relentless attack to force the stoppage as Dodd's corner threw the towel in.</p>

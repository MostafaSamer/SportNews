<P style=" font-size: 30px ;color: white" class="intro">The Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) was formed on 2nd December 1907 and is the world’s longest established professional sportsperson’s union.
The aims of the PFA are to protect, improve and negotiate the conditions, rights and status of all professional players by collective bargaining agreements.
The PFA has been successful throughout its history in the challenges it has faced due to the strength of support from its members.
In 1978 a player’s right to move at the end of his contract was fully recognised with a more efficient procedure being established. An Appeals Committee with an independent chairman was set up to consider disputes arising from the question of a compensation (transfer) fee and the PFA is represented on this committee.
Also, in 1978 the PFNC was established with equal representation of the PFA and the Football League under an independent chairman to meet on a regular basis and under this committee all matters affecting the game and players are discussed and no changes to a player’s conditions may be made without PFA agreement.
This committee was renamed in 1992 to the PFNCC (Professional Football Negotiating and Consultative Committee) to include the Football Association and the newly formed Premier League.</P>

               Bristol City's teenage forward Lauren Hemp has been crowned the women's PFA Young Player of the Year in association with Sodexo at the 45th PFA Awards in London.
             Fiery, fleet-footed and scoring goals for fun, Lauren Hemp is sure to be a name on the lips of WSL1 pundits for many years to come.
             The exciting forward broke into the Bristol City side in 2016, scoring on her debut when she came on as a substitute against Yeovil.

 Chelsea and England forward Fran Kirby has been crowned the women's PFA Players' Player of the Year in association with Sodexo at the 45th PFA Awards in London.
The player nicknamed 'mini-Messi' has overcome adversity to impress again this year by banging in the goals for Chelsea and England, including a strike against France in the recent SheBelieves Cup.
Hailed as a 'mini-Messi' by former Lionesses coach Mark Sampson, Kirby was the top scorer in the 2017 Spring Series as Chelsea topped the league.
Although the start of her year was marred by injury, she returned with a clear demonstration that her instinct for goal had not been dulled, scoring six times in two starts and three substitute appearances.
When she got her first goal, she was mobbed by her ecstatic team-mates, who knew how hard she had worked to get back to full fitness.
“The girls’ support for me was incredible,” Kirby recalled. “Everyone was cheering when I came on. When I scored, everyone came over to celebrate. Little things like that really mean something in the team. Everyone wants each other to do well.”
That meant she was all set for England’s campaign at Euro 2017, when she played in four of the Lionesses’ five games en route to the semi-finals and scored against Spain in the group stage.
The striker came through the ranks at her hometown club of Reading, making her first-team debut at the age of 16 and catching the eye with her goalscoring feats.

Manchester City winger Leroy Sané has been crowned the Men’s PFA Young Player of the Year in association with Forever Hope Foundation at the 45th PFA Awards in London.

The German winger has been unplayable at times this season for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side, with his electric pace, invention and ability to exercise extreme close control while running at speed, leaving many a Premier League defence trailing in his wake.

Sané has been one of many success stories in City’s dominance across the board this season, but the tricky winger has stood out for his ability to unlock stubborn opposition defences and drive to the by-line.

A lithe figure most commonly deployed on City’s left wing, Essen-born Sané began footballing life at German club SG Wattenscheid 09, for whom his father also played. He played for Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga before signing for City in August 2016 and was shortlisted for PFA Young Player of the Year in his debut season.

Despite lighting up the league with his pace, skill, and invention, Sané was hampered by nasal congestion which affected his breathing and he had corrective surgery during the summer of 2017. Whether because of that, the mentorship of Guardiola or his own growing maturity as a player, Sané has moved up a gear this season and is now one of the most feared wingers in Europe.

Liverpool's Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah has been crowned the men's PFA Players' Player of the Year at the 45th PFA Awards in London.
The mesmeric Egyptian forward has taken the Premier League by storm this season, leaving a trail of despairing defenders in his wake. He has played the starring role in Liverpool’s dynamic front three and his eye-popping goal-scoring form makes him the clear favourite for the Golden Boot.
Salah sometimes looks to be playing the game on fast forward. From his time at Chelsea, fans of the Premier League were in no doubt about Salah’s electric pace and dribbling ability, but even his most enthusiastic admirers could not have predicted quite how goal-laden his season would become.
It is rare that players with Salah’s skill-set have the end product to match, but the Egyptian has it in buckets and has been simply irrepressible for an exciting Liverpool team this term. At the time of writing he is four clear in the Premier League goal-scoring charts and has also provided an impressive nine assists for his team-mates, with his Champions League form equally spectacular.
Beginning his career at Egyptian side El Mokawloon, Salah has had spells at FC Basel, Chelsea, Roma and Fiorentina on loan, but it is at Liverpool that he is showing his true potential. His ability to jink and fly past opposition defenders is amazing, but he has also demonstrated the vision and decision-making to pick a pass at the right time and combines his invention with a finish as clinical as any around. His link-up play with team-mates such as Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané is breath-taking on occasion.

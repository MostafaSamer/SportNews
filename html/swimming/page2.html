      <h1>Bob Bowman</h1>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was also during his work at NBAC that Bowman began coaching 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael &nbsp &nbsp Phelps. Under Bowman's tutelage at the North Baltimore Aquatic club, Phelps won five World Championship gold medals and was named the American Swimmer of the Year from 2001 to 2004.While at Michigan, Bowman worked closely with Greg Harden, then the sport administrator for swimming. Harden spoke often with both Bowman and Phelps during their time in Ann Arbor leading up to the 2008 Olympics, and he often helped one communicate better with the other. Bowman gives Harden some of the credit for all the success Team USA had in the pool in Beijing. Bowman even says Harden was one of the major reasons he came to Michigan in the first place. Bowman on Harden: “He’s a miracle worker. He made me a better coach, and a better person.Bowman was named as an assistant coach on the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team, serving as the primary coach for Phelps. At the 2004 Games, Bowman helped coach Phelps to eight medals, including six gold medals and two bronze. Four years later, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he coached Phelps to achieve eight Olympic gold medals, Under his supervision, BSL improved to a top five program regionally after finishing out of the top 20 the previous 10 years.</p>

       <h1>Jason Calanog</h1>
       <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Caeleb Dressel is doing things that many fans of the sport find unbelievable. Whether it’s making an 18-second 50 look easy, or going 40.00 in the 100 Free, to not breathing on the last lap of fly, the list of his feats keeps growing.
It’s important not to lose the perspective that he’s actually been preparing to do many of these feats for most of his swimming career.
Jason Calanog, the assistant coach for Men’s Swimming at Texas A&M, was one of Caeleb’s developmental coaches at The Bolles School. While on the Coaches Corner Jason talked about the approach that went into Caeleb’s progression and what he still does with the “sprinters” he coaches.
“I don’t just do 2,000-3,000 yards with them. You know sometimes these sprinters are doing 5,000 or 6,000 yards a practice. It’s a little bit of a different approach in that I want them to become swimmers.My goal is for you to be a swimmer not just a ‘sprinter’ and when you’re 25 or 26, when you’re a man or a pro swimmer that’s a little bit different situation. But as a college person who’s 18 or 19, I want you to be called a swimmer.I think that’s what’s special and what’s impressive about what Caeleb’s doing right now. The world is seeing him do things that they never thought sprinters would do but he’s been training this way his entire life.</p>

       <h1>Lea Maurer</h1>
       <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is not a day that goes by that my connection to Stanford does not have an impact on my life.  The Stanford community is a special place bound together by a group of people pursuing dreams in so many areas.  I will always be a part of that community and am honored to share the connection with the women I’ve brought in, my teammates when I swam here, my husband, Erik, who I met here and so many others that are a part of my Stanford family.” said Maurer of the decision.The Stanford women didn’t have a great Olympic Trials meet, though they weren’t bad either. Their best shot at the Olympic Team was Elaine Breeden, who looked very good through two rounds of the 100 fly but couldn’t put things together in the final. They failed to put a swimmer on the Olympic Team for the first time since 2016.Sources tell us that this was a total surprise to most around the program, this was a totally unexpected move headed into Olympic Trials, and that the athletes were only informed of the decision today.</p>

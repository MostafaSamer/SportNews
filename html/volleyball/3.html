The second one, the Swiss guys were better from the beginning, they really pushed on the serve and with their good defence and we were not able to score any transitions. The tie-break I would say was similar, in the beginning we were leading by a lot, the Swiss guys were under pressure and then of course they came back in the match and we were the ones under pressure, we were the ones making mistakes and again as in the whole tournament so far, we were the lucky ones in the end,” said Perusic. </q>
